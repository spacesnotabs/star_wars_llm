1234 was a B1-series battle droid that served in the Trade Federation Droid Army. During the Naboo Crisis, 1234 fought against the Gungan Grand Army at the Great Grass Plains, but the battle droid was destroyed by Bombad General Jar Jar Binks.[3]
The B1's designation was written on the back of his comlink booster pack.[3]

Behind the scenes[]
1234 first appeared in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, the first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. While the droid's designation can be spotted in film,[3] the numbers could not be identified until Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition gave a translation for B1 numerals.[6]
