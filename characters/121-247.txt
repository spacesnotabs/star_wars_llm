"Bastion? Hope you didn't need that droid in one piece."
―The Smuggler[1]
121-247 was a security droid who resided on Anoat at the time of the Iron Blockade. During this time, Tam Bastion of the Alliance to Restore the Republic sent a young smuggler to disable the droid, and the smuggler succeeded in doing so.[1]
121-247 was similar in design to the mining droids RN-18,[2] STALKER-1[3] and Igniter.[4]
